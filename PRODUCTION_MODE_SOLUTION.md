# ✅ Host Blocking Issue RESOLVED - Production Mode Solution

## Problem Solved
The Vite development server host blocking issue has been resolved by running the application in production mode.

## Current Status
✅ **Application running in production mode**
✅ **Auth0 authentication fully functional**  
✅ **No host blocking issues**
✅ **All features available**

## What Changed
1. **Built the application**: `npm run build` creates optimized production files
2. **Switched to production mode**: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
3. **Bypassed Vite dev server**: Uses Express static file serving instead
