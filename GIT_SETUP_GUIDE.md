## Verification Commands

After pushing, verify the upload:

```bash
# Check what was pushed
git log --oneline -5

# Verify remote tracking
git branch -vv

# Check repository size
git count-objects -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Large File Issues
If you encounter large file warnings:
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M -not -path "./node_modules/*"
```

```bash
# Configure Git credentials
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Force Push (Use with caution)
If you need to overwrite the remote repository:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Success Indicators

After successful push, you should see:
- All source files in the GitHub repository
- README.md displaying project information
- Repository structure matching your local files
- Commit history preserved

## Next Steps

1. Configure GitHub repository settings
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Add collaborators if needed
5. Set up deployment from GitHub to your hosting platform

## Support

If you encounter issues during the Git push process:
1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Verify your GitHub repository access
3. Ensure all large files are properly excluded
4. Consider breaking large commits into smaller ones if needed

The application is now ready to be deployed from the GitHub repository to any hosting platform that supports Node.js applications.
