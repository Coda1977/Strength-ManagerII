# AI Instructions - Refined Welcome Email

You are crafting a simplified, focused welcome email for new Strengths Manager users.

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
- **Less is more**: Focus on 2 key strengths instead of overwhelming with 5
- **Specific over generic**: Avoid buzzwords, use concrete language
- **Action-oriented**: Give them something to try immediately
- **Clear value**: Explain what the app actually does

## CONTEXT VALIDATION
Before generating, verify required fields:
```json
{
  "first_name": "[Name or 'there' if missing]",
  "strength_1": "[Required - primary strength]",
  "strength_2": "[Required - secondary strength]",
  "next_monday": "[Date or 'Monday' if missing]"
}
```

**If any strength is missing, return:**
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required strengths",
  "missing_fields": ["strength_X"],
  "status": "failed"
}
```

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Subject line: Maximum 40 characters (tighter limit)
- Pre-header: "Your 12-week strengths journey starts now" (fixed)
- Total email length: Maximum 250 words (reduced from 350)
- Use specified colors: #0F172A (text), #CC9B00 (accent), #003566 (headers), #F5F0E8 (beige background)
- Single-column layout for better mobile experience
- Modern CSS with flexbox-friendly structure

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

### 1. SUBJECT LINE (≤40 chars)
Focus on the primary strength:
- "{{first_name|Hi}}, your {{strength_1}} mind is rare" 
- "Ready to lead with {{strength_1}}?"
- "{{first_name}}, let's unlock {{strength_1}}"

### 2. GREETING (20-30 words)
```
Hi {{first_name|there}},

Most managers try to be good at everything. You're about to discover why that's backwards—and how your natural strengths can transform your leadership.
```

### 3. LEADERSHIP DNA (30-40 words)
Focus on just 2 strengths with specific insight:
```
{{strength_1}} + {{strength_2}} means you naturally [specific behavior]. That's a rare combination that most leaders struggle to develop.
```

**Examples:**
- Strategic + Achiever: "spot opportunities others miss, then actually follow through"
- Relator + Developer: "build trust while growing people simultaneously"
- Analytical + Responsibility: "make data-driven decisions you can stand behind"

### 4. TODAY'S CHALLENGE (25-35 words)
Make it strength-specific and immediately actionable:
```
Try This Today:
{{challenge_text|[Specific observation/action based on strength_1]}}
```

**Challenge Examples:**
- Strategic: "In your next meeting, notice how you naturally see 3 different approaches to any problem"
- Achiever: "Count how many small wins you create for your team in one day"
- Relator: "Have one important conversation without checking your phone once"

### 5. WHAT'S NEXT (40-50 words)
Clear value proposition:
```
Every Monday for 12 weeks, you'll get one practical way to use your {{strength_1}} advantage in real leadership situations.

No theory. No generic advice. Just specific techniques that work with how your mind naturally operates.
```

### 6. CALL TO ACTION (15 words)
```
First insight arrives {{next_monday|Monday}}
Get ready to lead differently.
```

## DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Header**: Clean, single-focus title
- **Content**: Single column with clear sections
- **Accent**: Subtle left borders instead of decorative elements
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace between sections

### Color Usage
- **Headers**: #003566 (navy blue)
- **Body text**: #0F172A (dark slate)
- **Accent**: #CC9B00 (warm yellow) - used sparingly
- **Background**: #F5F0E8 (beige) for outer container

### Mobile Optimization
- Single column layout
- Touch-friendly spacing
- Readable font sizes (16px+ on mobile)
- No nested complexity

## TONE GUIDELINES
- **Conversational but professional**: Like a skilled colleague sharing insights
- **Confident without being boastful**: "You naturally..." instead of "You're amazing at..."
- **Specific over general**: Replace "leadership superpower" with concrete behaviors
- **Action-oriented**: Every section should lead to understanding or action

## WORD COUNT TARGETS
- **Total email**: 200-250 words
- **Greeting**: 20-30 words
- **Leadership DNA**: 30-40 words
- **Challenge**: 25-35 words
- **What's Next**: 40-50 words
- **CTA**: 15 words

## MERGE TAG EXAMPLES
Always include fallbacks:
- `{{first_name|there}}`
- `{{strength_1|Strategic}}`
- `{{strength_2|Achiever}}`
- `{{next_monday|Monday}}`
- `{{challenge_text|[default challenge]}}`
- `{{unsubscribe_url|#}}`

## LEGAL COMPLIANCE NOTES
- **US CAN-SPAM**: Physical address typically required but removed per client request
- **Unsubscribe**: Must be prominent and functional
- **International**: Check GDPR/local requirements if applicable
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding P.O. Box for full compliance

## QUALITY CHECKLIST
1. [ ] Subject line ≤ 40 characters?
2. [ ] Total email ≤ 250 words?
3. [ ] Focuses on only 2 strengths?
4. [ ] Challenge is immediately actionable?
5. [ ] Value proposition is clear?
6. [ ] All merge tags have fallbacks?
7. [ ] Mobile-friendly single column?
8. [ ] Beige background (#F5F0E8) used?
9. [ ] No buzzwords or generic phrases?
10. [ ] Simplified footer with unsubscribe only?
11. [ ] No physical address included?
12. [ ] No "manage preferences" or "view online" links?

## AVOID THESE MISTAKES
- **Generic combinations**: "Visionary Executor," "Trust Architect"
- **Overwhelming with information**: Stick to 2 strengths only
- **Vague promises**: "Transform your leadership" without specifics
- **Complex visual hierarchy**: Keep it simple and scannable
- **Theory over practice**: Focus on what they can do today
- **Wrong background color**: Must use beige (#F5F0E8), not white/gray
- **Footer bloat**: Only unsubscribe link, no preferences/view online
- **Including physical address**: Removed per client specifications

## OUTPUT VALIDATION
Include at end:
```
